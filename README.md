Emotions are complex, often overlapping, and can be expressed in subtle ways through language. Detecting them automatically is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in mental health support, customer experience analysis, conversational AI, and social media monitoring.

In this repo, I've built models that can classify short text entries (English language) into multiple emotion categories. The dataset contains five emotions:
Anger
Fear
Joy
Sadness
Surprise
Each label is binary (1 = present, 0 = absent), and each text may have multiple emotions at once. This makes it a multi-label classification problem.
